# FBGrab

FBGrab is a framebuffer screenshot program, capturing the linux frambuffer and converting it to a png-picture. FBGrab is delivered as is without any warranty and license is GPL version 2, see tar-ball for details.

FBGrab interacts with the framebuffer directly using system calls and Linux-specific headers. Since it is dealing with framebuffer, `sudo` is required

## NAME

       fbgrab - takes screenshots using the framebuffer device

## SYNOPSIS

       fbgrab [options] filename

## DESCRIPTION

       fbgrab  reads  the  framebuffer device (/dev/fb*) or a dump thereof and
       saves a PNG image file. You can use it for  making  screenshots  of  of
       virtually  any  application, from traditional test applications to your
       X-windows desktop, as well as framebuffer applications.

## OPTIONS

       -?     print usage information.

       -a     ignore the alpha channel, to support pixel formats like BGR32.

       -b bitdepth
              the number of bits per pixel used, optional  when  reading  from
              device.

       -c console
              specifies which console (or virtual terminal - like other people
              call this feature) to grab. Sometimes this  changing  is  faster
              then  the  framebuffer  is  refreshed  (especially when grabbing
              framebuffer apps). If so, you should use  -C  console  ...  This
              waits some time before grabbing. You can't use -s in this case.

       -d device
              specifies  which  framebuffer device you want to read. If you do
              not use this option, it takes the  value  from  the  FRAMEBUFFER
              environment  variable. If no FRAMEBUFFER environment variable is
              given or if its value is NULL, then DEFAULT_FB  is  taken.  (see
              source code), which usually is /dev/fb0.

       -f filename
              Read from from file instead of device, requires that -w (width),
              -h (height) and -b (bitdepth) are specified.

       -h height
              the height of the frambeuffer in pixels, optional  when  reading
              from device.

       -i     turns off interlacing. If you do not want ADAM7 interlacing, you
              should use the -i option.

       -l line length, a.k.a. stride.
              the length  in  pixels  between  the  start  of  each row in the
              framebuffer, which might be larger or equal  to  width. Optional
              when reading from device.

       -s seconds
              specifies how many seconds to wait before grabbing. fbshot  does
              not  lock console switching, so you can switch it while waiting,
              if you cannot use -c requires normally that  fbgrab  is  run  as
              root.

       -v verbose
              be verbose

       -w width
              the  width  of  the frambeuffer in pixels, optional when reading
              from device.

       -z     set png compression level 0 (fast) to 9 (best).

## TODO

       * Low-end bit depths, eg 1, 2, 4 & 8 bits.

       * Companion program fbput that would display a  picture  in  the  fram‚Äê
       buffer.

       * Better utilization of the PNG-lib, all formats are first converted to
       32 bitdepth and then stored as PNG - hardly the right approach.

## EXAMPLES

       fbgrab fb.png

       will take a framebuffer snapshot, or if you don't have fbgrab  at  your
       machine, you can do

       cp /dev/fb0 framebuffer.dump

       and then

       fbgrab -w 1024 -h 768 -b 16 -f framebuffer.dump fb.png

       to convert it to a picture.

# Release notes

## Unreleased

- $prefix flag was added to allow install to different directory like /opt. Thanks to @davidak.
- Remove some superfluous casts of variables to their type. Thanks to @sawuare.
- Setting compression level from commandline now work again. Thanks to @anthony-loiseau-act.
